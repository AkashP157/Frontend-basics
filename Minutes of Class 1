1) Details regarding basics of HTML
	HTML is a markup language, different from other programming languages such as C++ or Python
	HTML consists of tags. Each tag must have one opening and closing tag. 
	Basic tags in HTML 	
		<html>
		<head>
			-
			-
		</head>
		<body>
			-
			-
		</body>
		</html>
	Each tag must have an opening and closing tag.
	Saving the file with extension .html and opening it in an browser, the browser compiles the html code and displays the webpage.
	To comment in HTML, use <!-- (COMMENT) --> tags
2) Tags covered
	a) p - Paragraph
	b) H1 , H2 ,H3 -- H7 - Heading tags, with decreasing font size(H1 the maximum)
	c) a - Link tag (Syntax) -- <a href="**address of webpage**">(text/image)</a>
	d) Image tag - <img src="**address of image**"> -- img is a special tag that doesnot have a closing tag.
	e) Style attribute - There are different ways to format a webpage 
		i) Inside a tag -- <p style = "font-family:sans-serif;">**text**</p>
		ii) In the head tag -- <head>
								<style> 
								p
								{ font-family:sans-serif;
								}
								</style>
								</head>
		iii) In external file termed as CSS
3) CSS - It stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to control the formatting of webpages externally.
	a) Linking a css file to HTML file
		add the link tag in head of the html file. (syntax --> <head> <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href="**address of css file"> ** the link tag has no closing tag)
	b)In the css file, each element/tag can be accessed. This is done as - 
		example with p tag, accessing it from external css, and then changing its color
		p{
		color:blue;
		}
	b.1) If we need to change the color of one of the p tags, we can use id or class
	In HTML code -->	<p id="id1">(text)</p>
	In CSS code --> #id1{ color:red;	}
	In HTML code --> <p class="class1">(text)</p>
	In CSS code --> p.class1{ color: gray;	}
	c) A class independent of a tag can also be defined in CSS, to do that 
		CSS Code --> .class-name{ formatting }
		The class-name can be added as the class value in various tags to add that formatting
